- This is a simple item list that is built using the MERN stack and is an introduction to using MERN.

**What Is MERN? :**

MERN:

- MERN stands for MongoDB, ExrpessJS, ReactJs, and NodeJS. 
The main purpose in using these technologie together is that you are using a stack that only requires javascript as opposed to several languages that could be difficult to connect to one another.
ReactJS serves as the front-end (or client side) where the UI is made up of React components. Changes in data from the front-end are sent to the NodeJS/ExpressJS based back-end (server side) which stores the data in MongoDB.

MongoDB:

- A no-sql database to store data.

ExpressJS:

- A javascript framework used along with NodeJS to build the back-end of a website.

ReactJS:

- A javascript framework used to build the front-end user interface.

NodeJS:

- A javascript run time environment used to run javascript outside of a browser onto a machine.
